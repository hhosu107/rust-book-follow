# 6_2 The `match` control flow construct

Rust Patterns can be made up of literals, variabel names, wildcards, ...(ch 18).
Thw power of `match` comes from the expressiveness of the patterns and the fact
that compiler confirms that all possible cases are handled.

Ex)
```rust
enum Coin {
  Penny,
  Nickel,
  Dime,
  Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
  match coin {
    Coin::Penny => 1,
    Coin::Nickel => 5,
    Coin::Dime => 10,
    Coin::Quarter => 25,
  }
}
```

- Seems similar with `if`, but there is a big difference.
  - `if`'s condition needs to evaluate to a Boolean value, but here it can be
      any type.
  - Match arms are made up of two parts: a pattern and some code, connected with
      `=>` operator that separates the pattern and the code to run.
    - Each patterns are connected with `,`.
  - When the `match` executes, it compares the resultant value against the
      pattern of each arm in order.
    - If pattern matches, the code associated with that pattern is executed.
  - The code associated with each arm is an expression, and the resultant value
      of the expression in the matching arm is the value that gets returned for
      the entire `match` expression.
  - We must use curly brackets after `=>` when we want to run more than one line of
      code in a match arm.

## 6_2_1 Patterns that Bind to Values

- When some enum variants contain the data inside it, we can still use `match`.
```rust
#[derive(Debug)] // So we can inspect the state in a minute
enum UsState {
  Alabama,
  Alaska,
  // --snip--
}

enum Coin {
  Penny,
  Nickel,
  Dime,
  Quarter(UsState),
}
fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter(state) => {
            println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
            25
        }
    }
}
```
- When we call `value_in_cents(Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska))`, `coin` would be
    `Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska)`, and the state will be `UsState::Alaska`.
  - Thus we can get out the inner state value out of the `Con` enum variant.

## 6_2_2 Matching with `Option<T>`
- As we already seen above, `match` with `Option<T>` works as:
```rust
fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
    match x {
        None => None, // Increment None is useless.
        Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
    }
}

let five = Some(5);
let six = plus_one(five);
let none = plus_one(None);
```
- Combining `match` and enums is useful in many situations.
  - This pattern is common in Rust codes.
  - `match` agains an enum, bind a variable to the data inside, and then execute
      code based on it.

## 6_2_3 Matches are exhaustive.

- The sum of arms must cover all possibilities.
```rust
fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
    match x {
        Some(i) => Some(i + 1), // pattern `None` not covered. Help: `None =>
                                // todo!()` just for type checking.
    }
}
```
- Rust knows that we didn't cover every possible case, and even knows which
    pattern we forgot.
  - Especially in the case of `Option<T>`, Rust protects us from assuming that
      we have a value when we might have null.

## 6_2_4 Catch-all patterns and the `_` Placeholder
- Catch-all pattern example
```rust
    let dice_roll = 9;
    match dice_roll {
        3 => add_fancy_hat(),
        7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
        other => move_player(other), // matches any and bind to that value.
        // This code compiles even though we haven't listed all the possible
        // values a `u8` cna have, because the last pattern will match.
        // Note that we have to put the catch-all arm last because the patterns
        // are evaluated in order. Rust will warn us if we add arms after a
        // catch-all.
    }

    fn add_fancy_hat() {}
    fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
    fn move_player(num_spaces: u8) {}
```
- `_` placeholder example
```rust
    let dice_roll = 9;
    match dice_roll {
        3 => add_fancy_hat(),
        7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
        _ => reroll(), // `_` is a special pattern that matches any value and
                       // does NOT bind to that value. This tells Rust we aren't
                       // going to use the value.
    }

    fn add_fancy_hat() {}
    fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
    fn reroll() {}
```
- `_` another example: do nothing at some arms
```rust
    let dice_roll = 9;
    match dice_roll {
        3 => add_fancy_hat(),
        7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
        _ => (), // unit value.
    }

    fn add_fancy_hat() {}
    fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
    fn reroll() {}
```
