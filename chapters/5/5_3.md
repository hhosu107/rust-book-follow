## 5_3 Method Syntax

_Methods_ are similar to functions: declare with `fn`, take arguments, and
return a value, contains some code to be run.
- Unlike functions, methods are defined within the context of a struct (or an
    enum or a trait object (Ch 6/17).
- Their first parameter is always `&self`, representing the instance of the
    struct the method is being called on.

- Change 5_2's example:
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

// To define the function within the context of the struct Rectangle, start an
// `impl` block (implementation). Everything we define within the `impl` block
// will be associated with the `Rectangle` type.
impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 { // Instead of giving a rectangle object as a
                            // parameter, use _method syntex_.
                            // &self is short for self: &Self (alias for the
                            // type that the impl block belongs for).
                            // Also, methods must 'borrow' the instance, not
                            // taking ownership of them. So attach &.
                            // We can also borrow self mutably: &mut self.
                            // When we use `self`? When the method transforms
                            // `self` into something else and we want to prevent
                            // the caller from using the original instance after
                            // the transformation.
                            // Also using _methods_ instead of functions has
                            // additional reasons: for organization.
                            // We've put all the things we can do with an
                            // instance of a type in one `impl` block rather
                            // than making future users of our code search for
                            // capabilities of `Rectangle` in various places in
                            // in the library we provide.
        self.width * self.height
    }
    fn width(&self) -> u32 { // rect1.width: rust knows we mean the field.
                             // rect1.width(): rust knows we mean the method.
                             // Often but not always we give the same name
                             // to only return the value in the field and do
                             // nothing else. These are called _getters_, and
                             // Rust does NOT implement them automatically.
                             // Getters are useful to make field private but the
                             // method public, and thus enable Read-Only access
                             // to that field as part of the type's public API.
                             // Public, private, etc will be shown in Ch 7.
        self.width
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        rect1.area()
        // NOTE: Rust doesn't use -> operator that C/C++ does.
        // In C/C++, use `.` to call a method on the object directly.
        // Use `->` to call a method on a pointer to the object.
        // i.e., object->something() === (*object).something()
        // Rust doesn't have `->`; instead, Rust has a feature called
        // _automatic referencing and dereferencing_.
        // When you call a method with object.something(), Rust automatically
        // adds in `&`, `&mut`, or `*` so object matches the signature of the
        // method. Simply, `p1.distance(&p2)` is much cleaner than `(&p1).distance(&p2)`.
        // This automatic referening behavior works because methods have a clear
        // receiver: the type of `self`.
        // Given the receiver and the name of the method, Rust can figure out
        // definitively whether the method is reading (`&self`), mutating
        // (`&mut self`), or consuming (`self`).
    );
}
```

### 5_3_1 Methods with More parameters

- Example)
```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool { // Other paremters are
                                                   // just like function
                                                   // parameters.
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }
}
fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };
    let rect2 = Rectangle {
        width: 10,
        height: 40,
    };
    let rect3 = Rectangle {
        width: 60,
        height: 45,
    };

    println!("Can rect1 hold rect2? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect2));
    println!("Can rect1 hold rect3? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect3));
}
```

### 5_3_2 Associated Functions
- All functions defined within `impl` block are called _associated functions_
    because they are associated with the type named after the `impl`.
- We can define associated functions that **don't have `self`** as their first
    parameter (and thus are not methods) because they don't need an instance of
    the type to work with.
  - Ex) `String::from` is an associated function. It doesn't require any
      `String` object that is pre-defined.
- When associating, we can use `Self` since it is the alias of the original.
```rust
impl Rectangle {
  fn square(size: u32) -> Self {
    Self {
      width: size,
      height: size,
    }
  }
}

fn main () {
  let sq = Rectangle::square(3); // Function is namespaced by the struct with
                                 // `::` operator.
}
```

### 5_3_3 Multiple `impl` blocks
- Rust allows us to define multiple `impl` blocks for the same type.
- We'll see a case in which multiple `impl` blocks are useful in Chapter 10,
    where we discuss generic types and traits.

# 5_4 Summary

- Struct는 도메인에 맞는 커스텀 타입을 만들 때 유용하다.
- Struct를 사용해서, 데이터에 관련된 여러 조각들이 연결되어 있게 하고, 각 조각에
    이름을 붙여서 더 깨끗한 코드가 되게 한다.
- `impl` block 안에서, 타입과 관련된 function들을 정의할 수 있다.
  - _method_들은 struct의 instance가 가지고 있는 behavior를 정의하는 associated
      function들이다.
- Struct 이외의 커스텀 타입들을 만들 수도 있다. Enum이 한 가지 예시이다.
