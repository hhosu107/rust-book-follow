# 4_3 Slice Type

_Slice_ let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection
rather than the whole collection.
A slice is a kind of reference, which does not have ownership.

- Ex) Write a function that takes a string of words separated by spaces and
  returns the first word it finds in that string. If the function doesn't find a
  space, the entire string should be returned.

1. Without Slices
- Return the index that the first word ends:
```rust
fn first_word(s: &string) -> usize {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes(); // To check whether a value is a space.
    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() { // `iter` returns each element in a collection, and `enumerate` wraps the result of `iter` and returns each element as part of a tuple instead. The first element of the returned tuple is the index, and the second element is a reference to the element. We destructured `.enumerate` with tuple (i, &item). Since second element is a reference, we added &.
        if item == b' ' { // Found the first space.
            return i;
        }
    }
    s.len()
}
```

Problem: If that given string mutates, the index returned by `first_word` will
be invalid. Using that index after mutating the original index gives a bug.

2. With Slices

## 4_3_1 String Slices
A _string slice_ is a reference to part of a `String`:
```rust
let s = String::from("hello world");
let hello = &s[0..5]; // `&` is a reference operator.
let world = &s[6..11];
```
Rather than a reference to the whole `String`, each variable is a reference to a
portion of the `String`.
- [a..b]
  - Like this, we create slices using a range within brackets by specifying `[starting_index..ending_index]` (ending_index is exclusive).

  - Internally, the slice data structure stores the starting position and the
      length of the slice (ending_index - starting_index).
  - `hello`: ptr: "hello world"'s 0th index, len=5
  - `world`: ptr: "hello world"'s 6th index, len=5
  - Note that there is no `capacity` field in the slice data structure.
  - `&s[..2]` is equivalent to `&s[0..2]`.
  - `&s[3..]` is equivalent to `&s[3..s.len()]`.
  - `&s[..]` is equivalent to `&s[0..s.len()]`.
- Caution: String slice range indices must occur at valid **UTF-8 character
    boundaries.** If you attempt to create a string slice in the middle of a
    multibyte character, your program will exit with an error.
  - Sample program assumes ASCII. UTF-8 handling is described in Chapter 8.

- Our previous tedious function changes into:
```rust
fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str { // string slice's type is `&str`.
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[..i];
        }
    }
    &s[..]
}
```
- The returning value is made up of a reference to the starting point of the
    slice and the number of elements in the slice.

- Now let's implement the `second_word` function:
```rust
fn second_word(s: &String) -> &str {
  let first_word: &str = first_word(s);
  if s.len() == first_word.len() {
    return "";
  } else {
    let bytes = s[s.len()..].as_bytes();
    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
      if item == b' ' {
        return &s[0..i];
      }
    }
    &s[..]
  }
}
```
- We now have a straightforward API.
- Unlike index version, this version will show an error when the original string
    clears.
```rust
fn main() {
  let mut s = String::from("hello world");
  let word = first_word(&s); // Immutable borrow occurs here
  s.clear(); // Mutable borrow occurs here - error
  println!("the first word is: {}", word); // Immutable borrow later used here
}
```
- Recall from the borrowing rules that if we have an immutable reference, we
    cannot also take a mutable reference. `clear` mutates the string, so it
    needs to get a mutable reference. After that, println! uses the immutable
    reference, so that reference must still be active. Since Rust disallows both
    reference exist in the same time, compilation fails.

## 4_3_2 String Literals as Slices.
Recall that slices are `&str`. We know that String Literals are also `&str`.
Since `&str` is immutable, string literals are immutable.

## 4_3_3 String Slices as Parameters
- A More experienced Rusacean would write the signature of `first_word` as:
```rust
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
```
If we previously have a string slice, just pass. If we have a `String`, pass `&s[..]`.
- This flexibility takes advantage of _deref_ coercions (chapter 15).

Defining a function as a string slice makes our method more flexible and general
without losing any functionality:
```rust
fn main() {
    let my_string = String::from("hello world");

    // `first_word` works on slices of `String`s, whether partial or whole
    let word = first_word(&my_string[0..6]);
    let word = first_word(&my_string[..]);
    // `first_word` also works on references to `String`s, which are equivalent
    // to whole slices of `String`s
    let word = first_word(&my_string);

    let my_string_literal = "hello world"; // String literal's slice is also `&str`.

    // `first_word` works on slices of string literals, whether partial or whole
    let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[0..6]);
    let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[..]);

    // Because string literals *are* string slices already,
    // this works too, without the slice syntax!
    let word = first_word(my_string_literal);
}
```

## 4_3_4 Other Slices
- There are more general slice type too.
```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let slice = &a[1..3]; // &[i32]
assert_eq!(slice, &[2, 3]); // true
```
- It works the same way as string slices do, by storing a reference to the first
    element and a length. You'll use this kind of slice for all sorts of other
    collections.

## 4_3_5 Summary

The concepts of ownership, borrowing, and slices ensure memory safety in Rust
programs at compile time.
- The Rust language gives you control over your memory usage in the same way as
    other systems programming language, but having the owner of data
    automatically clean up that data when the owner goes out of scope means you
    don't have to wirte/debug extra code to get this control.
- Ownership affects how lots of other parts of Rust work, so we'll talk about
    these concepts further throughout the rest of the book.
- Chapter 5 is about Structs.
